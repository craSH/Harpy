Har.py is a module for parsing HTTP Archive 1.2.
http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/

There are some extensions made to the spec to gaurantee the original
state of the message. This software is designed to be used for web
testing, specifically security testing. Focus, therefore, has been
placed on reproducability and quick parsing of large datasets.

One of the design goals of this library is to make usage simple. This
code should work the way you think it would work. There are several
ways to use Har.py and these will be different depending on the goal
of the software using it. 


requires python-dateutil

There's a lot of manual parsing of queries, params, etc. This seems
like a stupid way to parse shit. I looked around a bit and didn't see
a library that did this already. I'll look around again later.
